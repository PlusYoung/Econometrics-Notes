## Featured Content: Econometrics Notes

I have published the complete version of my Econometrics Notes in PDF format under the "Releases" section. These notes were compiled during my self-study and examination preparation period. They are available for personal use and self-study.

Here is a glimpse of what's inside:
- Comprehensive coverage of key econometric concepts.
- References to Wuhan University's Econometrics PPTs and the classic book "Econometrics (Fifth Edition)" by Li Zinai.
- And much more!

I invite you to [download the Econometrics Notes](https://github.com/PlusYoung/Econometrics-Notes/releases) and delve into the world of Econometrics!
